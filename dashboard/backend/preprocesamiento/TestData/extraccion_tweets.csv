CevianSpriter,2019-11-17 06:12:09,"Pokemon Shield impressions. Probably gonna be a thread.

Game does feel a bit railroady, but it's pokemon I accept that. I feel like this game is a vertical slice of the conflict between the series linear nature and it's attempts to deliver on it's adventure/exploration themes."
CevianSpriter,2019-11-17 06:12:09,"This is evident mostly in the Wild Area.

Despite the lag I think the most fun I've had is just running around and exploring it. I feel like the fact it's not a full switch over to something like that is in part the Pokemon team being afraid to commit on any ""drastic changes."""
CevianSpriter,2019-11-17 06:12:09,Max Raid Battles have been really fun. Unbelievable. Getting a Pokemon to 0 health and then having a chance to catch it. I've had a few frustrating regular captures that could have benefited from the extra chance lower health gives.
CevianSpriter,2019-11-17 06:12:09,"Gym missions are cool. I hope they stay interesting as they have so far.

Gym battles are neat, but I feel like Dynamaxing would get tiring if I didn't know that all Pokemon gimmicks are transitory."
